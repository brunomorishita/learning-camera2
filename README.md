# learning-camera2

The aim of this project is just learning (or improve) my personal skills on C++, android and kotlin.
For that purpose I'm going to write a simple app using camera2 framework with native code to do object recognition.
I'd be glad if this could be used for people who wants to know more about writing apps for android
using native code.

## Project Description

The initial purpose was the study of the latest C++ standards (C++17 and "C++20") as well as the study
of kotlin and android camera2 framework (in which I'm a begginer yet).

This is my initial objectives:

 - Usage of C++17 for writing native code using camera2 framework
 - Usage of kotlin for UI and other stuffs
 - Usage of tensorflow lite in the native part for object recognition

 This is it for now. If I remember anything more I'll update here.
